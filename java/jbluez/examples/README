JBlueZ - Bluetooth Java Interface for Linux Using BlueZ
=======================================================

Examples Readme
---------------

This folder contains three small Java applications to demonstrate the use of the 
jbluez API. Details of what each program does and how this is achieved can be 
found at the top of the source code.

The programs are executed like any other Java program, e.g.:
    java Inquiry

Similarly, if you wish to modify them, compilation is also done in the usual 
manner, e.g.:
    javac Inquiry.java

Note that before compiling/running these applications, ensure the following:
* The file 'jbluez.jar' is included in your classpath;
* The location of 'libjbluez.so' is present in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
  variable.
* The local Bluetooth device, as represented by the hciDevID field is correctly 
  configured and is "up".
